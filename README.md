## Overview
This challenge helped me practice more positioning styles for my container. Media queries too were a huge part of ensuring that my project can be seen both in mobile and desktop view.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process
I used mobile first approach.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

Working on this project was a bit challenging especially while positioninig the images to look as required in the desktop version. However I managed to pull through using flexbox.
Adding the overlay was something I have never done and this was a good opportunity to learn how to add the overlay and even play around with the opacity.

```css
.container .picture .overlay{
   background-color: var(--Soft-violet);
   height: 500px;
   opacity: .5;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [ resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me to know how to add an overlay in the background of my image. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
